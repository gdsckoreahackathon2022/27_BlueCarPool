Climate change countermeasures ' CarPool '

### Reason for choosing a topic


Among the various climate changes, the rise in the Earth's temperature is a problem every year.

The main factor in increasing the global temperature is exhaust gas, including carbon dioxide. Exhaust gases trap solar heat from the Earth so that it cannot escape from the Earth, increasing the Earth's temperature.

I thought that small individual efforts were needed to reduce exhaust gas, and I tried to create a service that could practice these small efforts.

A factor that emits a lot of exhaust gas is 'automobile', and the use of automobiles accounts for a large proportion of human activities.

For this reason, we suggested "carpool" as a solution to reduce vehicles and developed a carpool service "blue_carpool" web service that will help us use carpools.


### How to use the service

Users who use the service sign up and log in.

Users can apply for a carpool by filling out the departure point, destination, vehicle number, number of carpool recruiters, and details of the carpool on the carpool application bulletin board.

Users who want to use the carpool can apply by pressing the reservation button, and if all the carpool recruiters are filled, it can be seen that it is closed.

If it occurs while using a carpool, you can post a report on the report board.

In addition, you can post a review post on the review board about whether the carpool was done well.
